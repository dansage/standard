# Security Policy
No software project is guaranteed to be free of security vulnerabilities, large or small. This policy outlines which
versions of the project are still considered to be supported and how any identified security issues should be reported.

## Supported Versions
With no official release, only the latest commit in the `main` branch is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a vulnerability within the project, please email me at [security@mail.dsage.org][1] with details. Please
keep in mind that this project is entirely self funded and no bug bounties are available.

To maximize the time I have available to work on this project, all AI/LLM generated reports will be discarded without a
response. If you believe your automation has discovered a real security issue, please take the time required to verify
and write the report yourself to respect my time. Thank you.
